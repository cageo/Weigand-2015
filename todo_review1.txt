Review 1
========

Todo points for reviewer #2
---------------------------

* change internal data formats so we can
	a) save all iterations
	b) easily (and fast!) recreate iterations
* test, and promote, ddps.py --plot functionality
* complete examples for dd_time.py and dd_space_time.py
	* especially for Windows
* Python 3 conversion
* Readme for Windows and Linux (txt and PDF)
* clear step-by-step guide on setting up the Python installation
* Documentation should be located not so deep in the directory structure
* Restructure HTML-documentation, provide a way to go through it
* Provide simple GUI for calling the routines (perhaps use web2py?)
	http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/14/other-recipes#How-to-distribute-your-applications-as-binaries
* redesign output format: one result file (i.e. matlab file, hdf5?)
	* I think we need some pluggable structure here, to provide the output
	  formats simple, to_directory, and to_meta_file, or something similar
*  audit trail: perhaps provide md5sums of all created files, and a
   corresponding check functionality in ddps.py?
* can we catch the Latex-errors of matplotlib
	* or even deactivate latex-output in Windows, and only reactivate it after
	  it was requested?
* activate issue tracker

Additional TODO
---------------

* fix normalisation (including documentation)
* add general Cole-Cole distributions
* add EM-Term


Reply bits
----------

* We ackowledge that controlling settings by means of environment variables can
  be quire cumbersome, especially on Windows. For the future, we plan to move
  these variables either to the command line options, or to a configuration
  file (bug url: ).  However, this will require substantial restructuring of
  the code base, and will require an corresponding amount of testing.
