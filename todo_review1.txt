Todo points for reviewer #2
---------------------------

* test, and promote, ddps.py --plot functionality
* complete examples for dd_time.py and dd_space_time.py
	* especially for Windows
* Python 3 conversion
* Readme for Windows and Linux (txt and PDF)
* clear step-by-step guide on setting up the Python installation
* Documentation should be located not so deep in the directory structure
* Restructure HTML-documentation, provide a way to go through it
* Provide simple GUI for calling the routines (perhaps use web2py?)
	http://web2py.com/books/default/chapter/29/14/other-recipes#How-to-distribute-your-applications-as-binaries
* redesign output format: one result file (i.e. matlab file, hdf5?)
	* I think we need some pluggable structure here, to provide the output
	  formats simple, to_directory, and to_meta_file, or something similar
*  audit trail: perhaps provide md5sums of all created files, and a
   corresponding check functionality in ddps.py?
* can we catch the Latex-errors of matplotlib
	* or even deactivate latex-output in Windows, and only reactivate it after
	  it was requested?
* activate issue tracker
